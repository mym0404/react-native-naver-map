![expo-release-it thumbnail](/social-image.png)

`expo-release-it` is an opinionated Expo CICD workflow CLI for building & uploading & submitting Expo projects on your machine

# Features

- 🎉 No **EAS**
- 🩵 No headaches when understanding and managing **keys and credentials**
- 🧩 Manage and sync **store metadata** easily
- 🌍 Works with [Expo CNG](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/continuous-native-generation/) mode (also available in non-CNG environments)
- 📦 Build artifacts **locally** (`apk`, `aab`, `ipa`)
- 🚀 Upload artifacts to Google Play Console Internal Testing Track and iOS TestFlight
- ✅ Submit releases for review


# Why?

**You don't need Expo EAS and to understand how it works in most small projects and our machine is much faster than using the cloud.**

  Expo EAS is convenient, but it requires additional configuration files, console setup, and a conceptual understanding of Over-The-Air (OTA) updates.
  Also, builds must be performed on EAS Cloud, which is not free and can be slow.

  While EAS is useful for larger teams, if you are developing alone or with just a few people and question the need for such a process, `expo-release-it` is the answer.

  Based on years of experience developing with React Native, I encourage a more traditional approach: build APK, AAB, and IPA files locally,
  upload them to each platform’s store testing track, and request reviews—without worrying about binary versions, OTA update versions, or branch management.

  This approach is much faster, simpler, and, most importantly, allows you to take full advantage of your computer’s fast CPU.

  I’m also a big fan of OTA updates, and I’ve enjoyed a lot of efficiency when working in larger teams, but it always required setting up many supporting systems in advance.

  `expo-release-it` is a CLI tool that encapsulates the know-how I have gained over years of automating build and review processes.
  Internally, it ports and integrates tools like Fastlane and Match to automate native binary builds and review requests.

  Therefore, this tool enforces an opinionated versioning, build, and review request workflow.
  However, once you understand this approach, your app deployment process will become significantly faster.
