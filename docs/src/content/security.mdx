# About Security

That’s right. You might be wondering whether storing files like `.p8`, keystore files, or key values in version control is truly secure.
In conclusion, if you’re using a private repository, you can consider it to be somewhat safe.

Whereas, you can exclude those key files from the VCS and share it to your teamates.

For example, Fastlane Match also uses OpenSSL encryption, but it still stores certificates and profiles in a private Git repository.

While you could implement additional security policies, I haven’t taken any extra measures for now.
If you need further encryption, you can build middleware in your pipeline that runs `expo-release-it` so that everything in the `expo-release-it` directory goes through encryption and decryption processes.

Any suggestions are welcome.
