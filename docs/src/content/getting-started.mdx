# Getting Started

You've got to follow each step to execute `expo-release-it`.

## 1. Ruby, Bundler

`expo-release-it` requires `bundler` of ruby is available in your environment to run `Fastlane` internally.

If not, set up your environment so that `ruby` and `bundler` are available by following [Ruby Install Guide](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/)

## 2. Prepare Keys & Credentials

`init` command generates sample key files structure in `expo-release-it/key`. They are **noob files** and you must replace file contents.

<Callout type={'warning'}>You must prepare all required key files in `expo-release-it/key` exactly the same filenames.</Callout>
<Callout type={'info'}>You can add the following files in `.gitignore` if you aren't sure about security issues. Treat them as `.env` and share it to your teammates.</Callout>

### `android_play_console_service_account.json`

Google Play Console actions require authentication using Google Service Account.

You can issue new Google Play Service Account by following Guide
and prepare `json` file.

- [How to Get Your Google Play JSON Key](https://help.radio.co/en/articles/6232140-how-to-get-your-google-play-json-key)

### `android_release.keystore`

Prepare your android release keystore file for **uploading** and **signing** Android build artifacts.

Additional passwords, alias will be prompted during the `init` command and be stored in `keyholder.json`.

### `ios_app_store_connect_api_key`

App Store Connect actions require authentication using App Store Connect Api Key(.p8)

Additional `issuer_id`, `key_id` values will be prompted during the `init` command and be stored in `keyholder.json`

- [Apple Docs Guide](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi/creating-api-keys-for-app-store-connect-api)

## 3. Create & Configure app on the stores as much as possible

Create and configure your application in Google Play Console & App Store Connect as many as possible.

You'd have to fill your key & credentials information using `init` command and pull store metadatas using `pull` command later.

You would need to upload & publish your first artifact, release manually at first.

## 4. Set binary version in expo config file.

The following buildNumber, versionCode format `ABBBCCC` is not mandatory but recommended for readability.

If your expo config file is `app.json`, then set like the following.

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "version": "1.2.3",
    "ios": {
      "buildNumber": "1002003"
    },
    "android": {
      "versionCode": 1002003
    }
  }
}

```

If your expo config file is `app.config.(js|ts|mjs|cjs)`, then set like the following.

```typescript
import type { ExpoConfig, ConfigContext } from 'expo/config';
const VERSION_NAME = '1.2.3'; // VERSION_NAME variable is required.
const VERSION_CODE = 1002003; // VERSION_CODE variable is required.

export default ({ config }: ConfigContext): ExpoConfig => {
  return {
    ...config,
    version: VERSION_NAME,
    ios: {
      buildNumber: VERSION_CODE + '',
    },
    android: {
      versionCode: VERSION_CODE,
    },
  };
};

```

## 5. Update `.gitignore`

```gitignore
# Expo Release It

expo-release-it/.temp
android/vendor/bundle
ios/vendor/bundle
# if you excluded android, ios for using CNG
!expo-release-it/metadata/*
# if you aren't sure about security issues, feel free to exclude these files from the VCS.
!expo-release-it/key/*.p8
!expo-release-it/key/*.keystore
```

## 6. Run `expo-release-it init`
