# Refer Spec - Load Project Specifications Context

Retrieve and use project specifications as knowledge by running `cc-self-refer spec {search|list|view}`

**Usage**: `/spec-refer <keyword>`

## Purpose

This command retrieves stored project specifications to restore development context from business requirements, technical architecture, and feature designs.

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT: CLI Command Execution Required

**This command MUST execute the following `cc-self-refer` CLI commands.**

### CLI Commands Used

```bash
npx -y cc-self-refer spec search <keyword> # Search specs by keyword
npx -y cc-self-refer spec list             # List all specs
npx -y cc-self-refer spec view <id>        # View specific spec
```

### Command Arguments
- `id`: Spec ID number (for view command)
- `keyword`: Search keyword or phrase (for search command)

### Expected Workflow
1. Search for relevant specifications using `npx -y cc-self-refer spec search <keyword>` (keyword is generated by claude code from user input)
2. Check search results:
  - If search result contains sufficient spec context, use that information directly
  - If search result only shows summary/metadata, use `npx -y cc-self-refer spec view <id>` for complete spec content
3. **APPLY the specification knowledge** to current development work:
  - Reference project requirements and constraints
  - **Focus on implementing features based on spec context**
  - Integrate the spec knowledge directly into current task execution
