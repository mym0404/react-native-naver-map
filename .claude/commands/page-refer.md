# Refer Page - Load Session History Context

Retrieve and use it as knowledge with running `cc-self-refer page {search|list|view}`

**Usage**: `/page-refer <keyword>`

## Purpose

This command retrieves saved session histories to restore context from previous development sessions. It enables continuity across multiple sessions and helps recover important development context and decisions.

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT: CLI Command Execution Required

**This command MUST execute the following `cc-self-refer` CLI commands.**

### CLI Commands Used

```bash
npx cc-self-refer page search <keyword> # Search pages by keyword
npx cc-self-refer page list             # List all pages
npx cc-self-refer page view <id>        # View specific page
```

### Command Arguments
- `id`: Page ID number (for view command)
- `keyword`: Search keyword or phrase (for search command)

### Expected Workflow
1. Search for relevant session pages using `npx cc-self-refer page search <keyword>` (keyword is generated by claude code from user input)
2. Check search results:
  - If search result contains sufficient session context, use that information directly
  - If search result only shows summary/metadata, use `npx cc-self-refer page view <id>` for complete session content
3. **APPLY the session knowledge** to current development work:
  - Reference previous decisions and architectural choices
  - **Focus on continuing the development work based on past session context**
  - Integrate the session knowledge directly into current task execution
